# 🥗 Kakuma Refugee Camp – Food Distribution Data Analysis

Prepared by: Akau Bior A.
Date: 05 December 2025

# 🏥 Introduction

Kakuma Refugee Camp in Northern Kenya is home to hundreds of thousands of displaced individuals who rely on humanitarian organizations for essential support — with food distribution being one of the most critical services. Despite ongoing efforts by NGOs, UNHCR, and implementing partners, challenges persist in ensuring equitable food allocation, accurate tracking of distributed commodities, and timely reporting.

This project uses data analytics to examine food distribution patterns, identify inefficiencies, and recommend evidence-based improvements. By transforming raw distribution records into actionable insights, the goal is to enhance transparency, efficiency, and fairness in the food supply chain within the camp.

⚠️ Business Problems
1. Distribution Variability & Inequities

Food rations sometimes vary across households or distribution centers due to logistical constraints, crowding, or reporting inconsistencies.

2. Data Quality Issues

Duplicate records, missing household IDs, inconsistent units, and manual errors make it difficult to maintain accurate distribution logs.

3. Inefficient Resource Tracking

There is no centralized, real-time visibility into:

Food stock levels

Distribution quantities

Underserved households

Commodity shortages

This limits responsive planning.

4. Delayed Decision-Making

Decision-makers rely on periodic, manually compiled reports that may not capture emerging shortages or distribution gaps in time.

# 🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis aims to:

Improve distribution efficiency: Identify delays, bottlenecks, and gaps.

Minimize ration discrepancies: Ensure households receive intended allocations.

Enhance data quality & accuracy: Standardize reporting and clean distribution logs.

Support evidence-based planning: Provide insights for optimizing stock and staff deployment.

Predict demand: Forecast food requirements using trends and seasonal patterns.

# 🧭 Business Understanding
Key stakeholders

UNHCR

WFP (World Food Programme)

NGO implementing partners

Distribution center managers

Refugee households

Context & Challenges

High population density and constant movement of households

Manual registration processes

Long queues and limited staffing

Complex supply chain logistics involving multiple agencies

Limited technological infrastructure

# ✔️ Success Criteria

A successful solution should:

Provide clean and accurate food distribution data

Visualize household coverage, supply gaps, and distribution trends

Track commodity stock levels and flag shortages

Generate actionable insights for resource allocation

Support predictive analytics for future demand

Be user-friendly for field teams

# 📊 Data Requirements
Data Needed

Household ID, size, and location

Distribution dates and cycle

Food items (e.g., maize, beans, oil)

Quantity received per household

Stock levels at distribution centers

Delivery/receipt logs

System Requirements

Central storage (Excel, SQL database, or CSV files)

Analytics tools: Excel, Power BI, Python

Automated alerts for:

Low stock

Distribution delays

Incomplete records

# 🛠️ Proposed Solutions
1. Data Analytics Dashboard

A Power BI or Excel dashboard displaying:

Total food distributed per cycle

Distribution coverage by zone

Households served vs. underserved

Commodity consumption trends

Real-time stock status

2. Inventory Management Insights

Use historical data to identify:

Peak distribution periods

Higher consumption commodities

Centers with persistent shortages

3. Predictive Modeling

Forecast:

Food demand for next distribution cycles

Seasonal spikes

Risk of shortages based on historical patterns

4. Automated Reporting

Generate weekly or monthly reports for UNHCR, WFP, and partners.

# 🔧 Tools Used

Excel: Data cleaning, calculations, pivot tables

Power BI: Dashboards and KPIs

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Data processing & visualization

SQL: Managing structured datasets

# 📁 Data Source

Simulated and cleaned datasets inspired by food distribution records typically used in humanitarian operations (e.g., UNHCR/WFP distribution logs).
No real refugee data is shared or exposed to protect privacy.

# 📝 Key Insights (Example Findings)

Identified underserved households during certain cycles

Cleaned duplicates and corrected 200+ inconsistent entries

Highlighted zones experiencing repeated shortages

Created decision-ready visualizations for logistics planning

# 📌 Recommendations

Centralized Dashboard: Implement real-time monitoring of stock and distributions.

Standardize Data Entry: Reduce inconsistencies and manual errors.

Enable Predictive Supply Planning: Forecast future demand based on trends.

Train Field Staff: Improve reporting accuracy and dashboard usage.

Increase Coordination: Strengthen communication between NGOs, UNHCR, and community leaders to avoid stock imbalances.

# 🔚 Conclusion

Data-driven approaches can significantly improve food distribution in Kakuma Refugee Camp by ensuring fairness, reducing shortages, and optimizing stock management. This project demonstrates how analytics, dashboards, and improved reporting processes can support better decision-making and ensure that vulnerable communities receive timely and adequate food assistance.
